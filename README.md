nfp-java-dao
============

**[Not-For-Production](https://github.com/hashiprobr/nfp) DAO framework based on
Cloud Firestore and Storage.**

If your project is a class assignment or a simple prototype, use this framework
to store objects and files remotely with minimum boilerplate. All you need is a
Firebase project and a couple of lines of code.


Quick setup
-----------

1) Open the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

2) Create a new Firebase project.

3) Create a **Firestore Database** in the project.

4) Create a **Storage** in the project. Take note of its URL.

5) Open the project settings (âš™) and download a new private key:

   * open the **Service Accounts** tab;

   * click on the **Generate New Private Key** button and confirm.

6) Rename the private key to something simpler like `main.json` and move it to
   somewhere safe. **Never commit this file, as it is private.**

7) [Add the framework to your
   project.](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.github.hashiprobr/nfp-dao)


Quick start
-----------

### Creating a storable object

Being a storable object only requires annotating one of its class fields with
`Key`. This is required because Firestore documents must be uniquely identified.

Firestore only accepts strings as keys. If the annotated field is not a string,
the actual value is obtained from `toString()`.

In the example below, we assume that the `id` of an user is unique.

``` java
public class User {
    @Key
    private int id;
    private String name;

    public int getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

### Creating a DAO for the object

A DAO for an `User`, as defined above, is an instance of a subclass of `DAO`,
with `User` as its parameter. The super constructor must receive the name of the
Firestore collection where you want the objects to be stored.

In the example below, we define that the collection is named `"users"`.

``` java
public class UserDAO extends DAO<User> {
    public UserDAO() {
        super("users");
    }
}
```

### Opening a Firebase connection

You need to open a Firebase connection to use a DAO, but you only need to do
this once.

In the example below, we assume that `"main.json"` is the private key and
`"example-12345.appspot.com"` is the aforementioned URL of the Storage.

``` java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Firebase firebase = Firebase.buildInstance("main.json", "example-12345.appspot.com");
    firebase.connect();
}
```

### Using the DAO for CRUD operations

The operations use the existent fields, getters, and setters as a reference for
what should be stored.

``` java
UserDAO dao = new UserDAO();
```

``` java
User user = new User(123, "John Doe");
dao.create(user);
```

``` java
User user = dao.retrieve("123");
```

``` java
User user = new User(123, "Jane Doe");
dao.update(user);
```

``` java
dao.delete("123");
```


Objects with automatic keys
---------------------------

If none of the class fields are unique, it is possible to add a new string field
and annotate it with `@Autokey`. This will make it be defined automatically.

In the example below, we assume that the `name` of a group is not unique, so it
cannot be used as the key.

``` java
public class Group {
    @Autokey
    private String key;
    private String name;

    public String getKey() {
        return key;
    }

    public void setKey(String key) {
        this.key = key;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

Creating a DAO in this case is exactly the same.

``` java
public class GroupDAO extends DAO<Group> {
    public GroupDAO() {
        super("groups");
    }
}
```

Using the DAO is also the same, with the added observation that `create` returns
the key that was created automatically.

``` java
GroupDAO dao = new GroupDAO();
```

``` java
Group group = new Group("Owners");
String key = dao.create(group);
```

``` java
Group group = dao.retrieve(key);
```

``` java
Group group = new Group("Admins");
group.setKey(key);
dao.update(group);
```

``` java
dao.delete(key);
```


Batch operations
----------------

All four CRUD methods have a list version.

* `public List<String> create(List<T> values)`

* `public List<T> retrieve(List<String> keys)`

* `public void update(List<T> values)`

* `public void delete(List<String> keys)`


File operations
---------------

All four CRUD methods have a file version.

* `public String create(String key, String name, InputStream stream)`

* `public String retrieve(String key, String name)`

* `public String update(String key, String name, InputStream stream)`

* `public void delete(String key, String name)`

These methods are supposed to be used for a file that is directly related to a
storable object. Therefore, the file path is `<collection>/<key>/<name>` and it
is expected that the key is from this object.

The `create`, `retrieve`, and `update` methods return an URL that can be used to
access the file as an static resource. For example, as the `src` of an `img`.
Please note that, due to some limitations, **updating a file changes its URL**.


Query operations
----------------

The `retrieve` and `delete` methods have a query version.

* `public List<T> retrieve(DAO<T>.Selection selection)`

* `public void delete(DAO<T>.Selection selection)`

To build a selection, you only need to call a select method from the DAO. This
method can be chained with the `orderBy`, `descending`, `offset`, and `limit`
methods for query constraints.

``` java
UserDAO.Selection selection = dao.select().orderBy("name").descending();
List<User> users = dao.retrieve(selection);
```

``` java
GroupDAO.Selection selection = dao.select().offset(10).limit(20);
dao.delete(selection)
```

All select methods available are listed below.

* `select()`: all objects.

* `select(List<String> keys)`: objects with keys in the list.

* `selectExcept(List<String> keys)`: objects with keys not in the list.

* `selectWhereIn(String name, List<Object> values)`: objects with the value of
  field `name` in the list.

* `selectWhereNotIn(String name, List<Object> values)`: objects with the value
  of field `name` not in the list.

* `selectWhereEqualTo(String name, Object value)`: objects with the value of
  field `name` equal to `value`.

* `selectWhereNotEqualTo(String name, Object value)`: objects with the value of
  field `name` not equal to `value`.

* `selectWhereLessThan(String name, Object value)`: objects with the value of
  field `name` less than `value`. *(assumes the field is sortable)*

* `selectWhereLessThanOrEqualTo(String name, Object value)`: objects with the
  value of field `name` less than or equal to `value`. *(assumes the field is
  sortable)*

* `selectWhereGreaterThan(String name, Object value)`: objects with the value of
  field `name` greater than `value`. *(assumes the field is sortable)*

* `selectWhereGreaterThanOrEqualTo(String name, Object value)`: objects with the
  value of field `name` greater than or equal to `value`. *(assumes the field is
  sortable)*

* `selectWhereContains(String name, Object value)`: objects with the value of
  field `name` containing `value`. *(assumes the field is an array)*

* `selectWhereContainsAny(String name, Object value)`: objects with the value of
  field `name` containing `value`. *(assumes the field is an array)*
